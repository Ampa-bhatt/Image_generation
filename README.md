Image Generation with Parameterized Models ðŸŒŒ  

 Overview  
This project leverages a state-of-the-art image generation model to produce high-quality images based on textual prompts. By introducing parameterization, users can fine-tune various aspects of the model, such as style, resolution, and layout, making it a powerful tool for diverse applications like digital art, marketing, and prototyping.  

 Features  
 ðŸŒŸ Key Functionalities  
- Prompt-based Image Generation: Create stunning images using natural language inputs.  
- Parameterization: Fine-tune the model's behavior with adjustable parameters for customized outputs.  
- Overlay Support: Add captions, labels, or text overlays to generated images.  
- Batch Processing: Generate multiple images simultaneously for efficiency.  

 Parameterization of the Model  
The model supports various parameters to control the output. These include:  

 1. Prompt Customization  
   - Description: The textual input guiding the model to generate the image.  
   - Example:  
     ```bash  
     python generate.py --prompt "A serene beach at sunset with palm trees"  
     ```  
2. Style  
   - Description: Adjust the visual style of the generated image (e.g., realistic, abstract, or cartoonish).  
   - Available Options: `realistic`, `abstract`, `cyberpunk`, `watercolor`  
   - Example:  
     ```bash  
     python generate.py --prompt "A futuristic city" --style "cyberpunk"  
     ```  
3. Resolution
   - Description: Set the resolution of the output image.  
   - Options:  
     - `low`: 512x512  
     - `medium`: 1024x1024  
     - `high`: 1792x1024  
   - Example:  
     ```bash  
     python generate.py --prompt "A forest in autumn" --resolution "high"  
     ```  

 4. Layout  
   - Description: Define the arrangement of images if multiple prompts are provided.  
   - Options: `grid`, `single`, `collage`  
   - Example:  
     ```bash  
     python generate.py --prompt "A sunny meadow" "A snowy mountain" --layout "grid"  
     ```  

# 5. **Overlay Text**  
   - **Description**: Add captions or labels directly onto the generated images.  
   - **Customization**: Font size, color, and position.  
   - **Example**:  
     ```bash  
     python generate.py --prompt "An enchanted castle" --overlay "Fantasy World" --font-size 20 --color "white"  
     ```  

 6. Seed  
   - Description: Set a random seed for reproducibility.  
   - Example:  
     ```bash  
     python generate.py --prompt "A galaxy far away" --seed 42  
     ```
